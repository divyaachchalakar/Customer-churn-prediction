# Customer-churn-prediction
In Dataset there are 10000 rows and 12 columns.
The nature of the column is Categorical so my approch towards this by the classification algorithms.
I have tried multiple classification algorithms such as Logestic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, NB, SVM, AdaBoost,XgBoost.
After doing the EDA I have observed the changes then I tried for Feature Engineering  and I have concluded the result using all the processes of Data Analysis.![image](https://github.com/divyaachchalakar/Customer-churn-prediction/assets/164302746/1abaf20c-7029-4721-a669-826d59b989dc)
